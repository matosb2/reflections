When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

You would want to use a remote repository when your local work is not available at
the moment.  Also you would want to use it when you are working with others on the 
same repository.  You may want to share the remote repository with others this way.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would want to do it manually because you would be able to control what changes you
want to pull.  Rather than just pulling every single new change every time.  It could be messier that way.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

Fork is basically a clone or copy of a repository only available through github and 
not locally.  Clone is a copy of a repository and can be done through both platforms,
locally or through github.  Branches are strings of commits or changes that have been 
made and logged and can also make up repositories.
